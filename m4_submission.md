<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I had trouble managing a way to read the guesses from the user<br>in the number generator. I overcame this by having it prefaced with guess<br>and then parse the message to recieve the number. This was because I<br>did not want any number to just be read as a guess as<br>that would hurt the code.<br></p><br></td></tr>
